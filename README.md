## Why
I wanted to continue learning Svelte and try out XState and state machines for the first time. Turns out both svelte and xstate are PERFECT for aplications like this. 

I also watched Queen's Gambit and now I'm a chess try hard thanks for listening to my ted talk. 

Play me: `voah` on lichess.org ðŸ’…
